                                                      My Initial Days in New Office


                             As my first organisation is Accenture where i got a job and my joining happended in corona situation because of that 
 I was not able to visit my office at my intial day of office.but i want to share my intial day exeprience which i did from remotely.so, On my first
 day of job, i got ready early in the morning and sit infront of my laptop.but eventually at that day nothing happended.only one mail i got at that
 day i.e for confirmation mail that yes you joining this organisation or not.

                             After that on monday i got a mail from my organisation i.e welcome to the Accenture.A introduction meeting schedule by my
 HR with other fellow members where we interact with each other, know about our organisation,their culture, their work environment.I personally interact
 with few colleagues of mine who now became my good friends.

                             within few days i got a mail to choose your stream course.So i choose Java technology after that all colleagues are
separated based on their stream and joined their own stream training group.then at the end,one of our organisation team i.e LKM Team schedule call with
our stream training mentor and after that our training started.that's how my intial day started in my new office.
