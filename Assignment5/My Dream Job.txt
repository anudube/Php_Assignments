                                                               My Dream Job


Life without Aim is like a ship without a sea.
My Aim is to become a software engineer when I grow up.
Studying engineering and becoming a software engineer has been a lifelong ambition of mine since i was a kid.
I'm working hard to full fill my dream to become a software engineer to achieve my dream I have to work very hard and spoil my mid night oil.
I aspire to choose this field because it is quite easy for a creative person.
Asides from this, i know if i want to survive in this world then i have to focus on my Aim to work hard to achieve this goal.
